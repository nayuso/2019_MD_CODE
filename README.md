# 2019_MI_Subsurface_Channel
A Computational Channel Model for Magnetic Induction based Subsurface Applications. 

This repository includes the MATLAB code referenced in (Ayuso et. al, 2019) with the following key points:
* Numerically computings magnetic field expressions to achieves computational accuracy and feasibility are comprised
* A method for accurately numericals evaluation of the Sommerfeld integral for subsurface applications is proposed
* Matlab implementation of the aforementioned points validated by comparative study with Finite Element Method by COMSOL simulations is provided

The present respository is organized as follows:

* MD_FIELD_EXPRESSIONS: magnetic field expressions for infinite medium and three-layered VMD, HMD
* CODE_PLOTS: code to generate plots in paper (Ayuso et. al 2019)
* CODE_DATA: data to generate plots in paper (Ayuso et. al 2019)
